# Taga STI ka kung kabalo ka magbasa Guidelines
There is a saying that rules are never meant to be followed but serve as guidelines. Guidelines however are for maintaining the status quo.

### Overview
The group observes [meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), you are most welcome to discuss inquiries that relate to your field otherwise practice the field of interest first before entering into a discussion.

#### Using of #hashtags
This is supposed to serve as a guideline for anyone who wants to post on this group. The guide implies what topics are supposed to be discussed here. If used correctly, you should be able to do this on search.

1. **#request** – all requests (meaning you’re asking someone to do something)

2. **#announcement** – any announcements from STI Bacolod regarding scholastic events, suspension of class, school holidays, etc.

### Inquiries
1. When posting questions, be sure that they are descriptive as possible, and make sure that no single important detail is left behind. Do not take vagueness into account like "who knows x, i have a problem".

2. When posting inquiries in regards to programming, post your code on [Ideaone](http://ideone.com) or [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) instead of posting it directly to the group discussion board.

3. Before posting inquiries make sure you already researched about it. Google is your friend.

4. It is better to answer inquiries through the thread not through private messages.

### Speech & Opinion
1. Respect – To simple things out, respect is earned and given not demanded nor asked.

2. Imperative Sarcasm – It is a part of the group's culture to include imperative sarcasm to their statements to give spice to the topic. Sarcasm may be considered as *relative trolling*.

3. Trolling – It's a norm, get over it.

4. Don't be a cry baby, you're only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the real world.

### Advertising
Advertisements of any kind are restricted to related content. Advertisement of groups or websites are not allowed until sanctioned by the administrators. You may message any admin on the group for this.

### Selling
The group will never be a marketplace, although we give a little exception to sell technology related items **IF** you don't need them anymore.
